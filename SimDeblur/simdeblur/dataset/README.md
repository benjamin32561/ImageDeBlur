## Detail Description
**sampling**: The sample mode  generating the input frames and gt frames. "n_c", "n_n", "n_r", "n_l" are the general options implemented in SimDeblur. Taking "n_c" for an example, 'n' before '\_' stands for n input frames assigned by "num_frames". 'c', 'n', 'r' after '\_' means the relative position relationship between input frames and gt frames. Specifically, 'r' is right, 'c' is center, 'l' is left and 'n' is n frames. The following picture depicts it clearly.

**augmentation**: The image augmentation for training. At now, it includes RandomCrop, RandomHorizontalFlip, RandomVerticalFlip,RandomRotation90, RandomReverse. Each of them has a Randomness controlled by a probability p (default is 0.5). 

**num_frames**: The number of input frames. Many video deblurring frameworks take 5 blurry frames as input, and single image deblurring alorithms take 1 blurry image for input. 

**Construct your own deep video deblurring dataset**
